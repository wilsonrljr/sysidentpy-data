## data sources: Energy Datasets

The datasets SanFrancisco_Hospital.csv and SanFrancisco_PV_GHI.csv are sourced from [Neural Prophet Dataset Github repository](https://github.com/ourownstory/neuralprophet-data).

Those datasets will be really useful for anyone interested in SysIdentPy time series modeling benchmarks available as examples of how to use SysIdentPy. The main goal is to provide the dataset to users to make sure they can reproduce all the examples available.

The original sources provided by Neural Prophet are detailed bellow (copy and paste from Neural Prophet Dataset repository):

 ### SF_PV
 The SanFrancisco_PV solar data comes from DOE/NREL/ALLIANCE (https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/about/tmy.html)

 The y values in the series correspond to  `GH illum (lx)`. The series contain a full year of hourly observations for 2015.

 ### SF_hospital_load
 SanFrancisco_Hospital load data comes from OpenEI (https://openei.org/doe-opendata/dataset/commercial-and-residential-hourly-load-profiles-for-all-tmy3-locations-in-the-united-states,  or https://data.openei.org/submissions/153)

 The y values in the series correspond to  `Electricity:Facility [kW](Hourly)`. The series contain a full year of hourly observations for 2015.

 The air_passengers.csv dataset is also from Neural Prophet Dataset repository.
